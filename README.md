"# PhpBasicMvcApp"

Unfortenetaly I can not set a Demo.
Github Pages is not a full-featured web host. It will not execute PHP. 


This is a basic MVC PHP app.
The App has four page:
1)home page
2)erroe page
3)Product list
4)Product details

DB:
I created (localy on my computer) a table named 'products' with the following columns
id (int, unique id) , name(varchar), price(float)

Hope you like it :)
